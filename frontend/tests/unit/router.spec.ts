// tests/unit/router.spec.ts
//
// This file is reserved for future route-related tests.
//
// You can use this file to:
// - Test navigation between routes (e.g., using router-link or programmatic navigation)
// - Test route guards, redirects, or dynamic route params
// - Mock or test Vue Router behavior in your components
//
// Currently, there are no custom routes or guards to test, but as your app grows,
// you can add tests here to ensure your navigation and routing logic works as expected.

import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
describe("Router", () => {
  it("dummy test", () => {
    expect(true).toBe(true);
  });
});

// Example (to be implemented in the future):
// import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
// describe('Router', () => {
//   it('navigates to the about page', () => {
//     // TODO: Add navigation test
//   });
// });
